     * Seriously though, what we have done here is more
     * impressive than just fixing to allow our tests to pass.
     * We've implemented a design patter. The adapter pattern.

     * GooglePlusFeedReader then we can plug it into the system
     * very easily. We have made it easier to maintain our

     * will thank us. Huzzah!

     * You know what? We aren't quite done yet.
     * Switch to the final part for some clean up.
